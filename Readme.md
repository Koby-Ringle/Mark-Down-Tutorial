# GitHubMarkDownTutorial
    Here is my mark down tutorial! These lines use heading 1, it is the largest.

## GitHub Heading 2
    This is the second heading
    it is a smaller font than the first

### GitHub Heading 3
    Finally these lines are with heading three the smallest of the common headings.

### Overveiw of markdown techniques
 - **Italics**- Made with asterisks on both side of a word. Ex:
    *The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog*
- **Bold**- Made with double asterisks on both sides of a word. Ex:
    **The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog**
- **Strike**- To strike through a word, two tilde are placed on both sides of it. Ex:
    ~~The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog~~
- **Block Quote**- To input a block quote one uses a right facing arrow (or greater than sign). Ex:
    >The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog
- **Links**- If you want to make use of a link then you need to use brackets and parenthesis. Ex:
    [Google](google.com)

## Types of lists
    I have been using bullets for the list thus far but there are other list formats available for use.
### Ordered List
1. Item One
2. Item Two

### Unordered List
* Item One- This was done with a single asterisk.
- Item Two- this was done with a single hyphen.
